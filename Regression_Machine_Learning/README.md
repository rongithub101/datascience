In this subfolder, you will see a machine learning regression project where I go through transforming 
categorical values into numerical ones(ie getting the email domain name and the state region and transforming them respectively into numerical values), scaling numerical values using StandardScaler, and then using Linear Regression/Random Forest Regressor and using GridSearchCV to optimize the 
hyperparamaters of the Random Forest Regressor model. Then I drew a couple of graphs showing y_test and 
the predicted values. Afterwards, I got the RSME, MAE, MSE errors for each model and printed them out. 
Please enjoy :)
